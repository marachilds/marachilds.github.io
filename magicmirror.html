                    <p class="body">Our team of four created a "magic mirror" prototype for two girls—Hayden, age eight, and Caroline, age six—after having them participate in a quarter-long design research process. We completed user performed a design ethnography, deployed a cultural probes kit, and led a participatory design workshop before developing and prototyping a solution concept.</p>

                    <p class="body">We set out to gain insight into our participants’ activities related to our topic of <em>Sports + Outdoors,</em> get to know the participants themselves, and observe the context in which these activities took place. Additionally, we kept a keen eye on any artifacts and/or tools that were used or that we noticed hanging out in the background. The girls were incredibly imaginative and found infinite uses for objects out of ambiguity. A jump-rope and closet bar became a pulley system for a stuffed panda. Immediately, we wanted to design to empower them.</p>

                    <p class="body">Ideally, we wanted an idea of the surprising, light and deep, absurd and unexpected, mundane and routine aspects of the girls' lives. Making a cultural probes kit for children was more difficult, as at their age, they are unable to produce long written responses or perhaps engage with things on a deeper level. As seen in the kit, we kept things very visual.</p>

                    <p class="body">Totally exceeding our expectations, the girls filled out all aspects of the kit, and took great care in its completion. We were surprised by the level of depth that was reached in the coloring book, as well as the objects that they selected to let us borrow. Our favorite example of imagination was Caroline's "ice-cream-eyes emoji" rendering, while we were hit hard by Hayden's depiction of her least favorite activity outside: playing alone. We were also intrigued by the Fitbit-like object that Caroline chose to include to represent one of her days.</p>

                    <p class="body">Under the umbrella of Sports + Outdoors and alongside our discoveries from the design ethnography and the cultural probes kit, we focused on the sheer number of sports that the girls participated in. We noted that while the girls were active in and seemed excited about many sports, there was little organization in their understanding of which ones they actually liked—if at all. From there, we drafted a number of Point of View statements and How Might We… statements to present as guidance towards our concept. </p>

However, having seen the "fun" aspects of what Hayden and Caroline enjoyed, we saw that they were drawn to things that garnered some form of reward. While one of our rejected concept ideas was purely a game, we decided to reintroduce the game aspect in order to incentivize the reflection process. </p>

As such, its screens are clean and the flow is simple. <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/fa9ba6e0-f366-4ef7-bf06-5c20393d8be6/" target="_blank">Click here to view the live demo.</a></p>

The mirror application is intentionally straightforward with little “fun” aspects apart from being able to change the clothing style as that is part of the “experience points” system. <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/a44383c1-379d-4f7f-9686-bda7a515e612/" target="_blank">Click here to view the live demo.</a></p>

                    <p class="body">We knew that choosing to work with kids would pose some interesting challenges apart from dealing with adults, but we found ourselves constantly delighted with the subtle complexities of their experiences. A lot of this came from what they wanted to tell us and the words that they used (being free from knowing what may have been "expected"). Personally, I learned a lot about working with participants and how designing for specific people can be so nuanced. Asking a lot of questions was generally met with some insights, but usually more questions, which was exciting.</p>
